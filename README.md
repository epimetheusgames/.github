## About Us

Based in Portland, OR, Epimetheus Games is a small game not-yet-company that consists of a team of five talented middle schoolers. We have currently made 2 games that have both won Best in Show in the Oregon Game Project Challenge: EyeSore and Project Prometheus. You can play both of them on our itch page.

## Playtesters

Thank you to all our playtesters for our games of which there are many! All of them endured crappy unfinished buggy versions of our game, found bugs, and helped us make our games great! This is an attempt at naming all of them. If you would like your name to be removed or added, email us.
