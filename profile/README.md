# Epimetheus Games

Based in Portland, OR, Epimetheus Games is a small game not-yet-company that consists of a team of five talented middle schoolers. We have currently made 2 games that have both won Best in Show in the Oregon Game Project Challenge: EyeSore and Project Prometheus. You can play both of them on our itch page.
