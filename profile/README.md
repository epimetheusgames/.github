# Epimetheus Games

Based in Portland, OR, Epimetheus Games is a small game not-yet-company that consists of a team of seven talented middle schoolers. We have currently made 2 games that have both won Best in Show in the Oregon Game Project Challenge: EyeSore and Project Prometheus. You can play both of them on our itch page. We are working on making a game for Season 18 of OGPC, although this one will probably not be open source. Some of our new members this year are from Flying Goose Games who competed in Season 17.
